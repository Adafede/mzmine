<h1>Sirius Export</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This module exports fragmentation spectra of peaks in the peak list into MGF (Mascot Generic Format) format file.
    This module is specifically formatted for use with the Sirius web-platform. 
    Sirius can be downloaded at the <a href="https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/">following address</a>.
    Sirius results can be mapped into GNPS molecular networks. See the documentation here.
    In addition to the spectra, the following peak characteristics are saved into the file:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>FEATURE_ID</dt>
    <dd>Row number in the peak list</dd>

    <dt>PEPMASS</dt>
    <dd>Mass of the peak. If each row in the peak list contains several peaks (e.g. after performing alignment), the
        mass of the highest peak is chosen
    </dd>

    <dt>RTINSECONDS</dt>
    <dd>Retention time of the peak. If each row in the peak list contains several peaks, the average retention time
    is chosen</dd>

    <dt>SCANS</dt>
    <dd>The same as FEATURE_ID</dd>    

    <dt>CHARGE</dt>
    <dd>The charge for the specified row</dd>

    <dt>MSLEVEL</dt>
    <dd>Either equals 1 (MS) or 2 (MS/MS)</dd>
