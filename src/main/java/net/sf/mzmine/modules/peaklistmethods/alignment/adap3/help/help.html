<h1>ADAP Aligner</h1>

<p>
    This alignment algorithm has been developed as part of ADAP-GC v1.0, Automatic Data Analysis Pipeline for processing
    GC-MS metabolomics data.
</p>

<p>
    For details, see Jiang, W.; Qiu, Y.; Ni, Y.; Su, M.; Jia, W.; Du, X.: <b>An automated data analysis pipeline for GC-TOF-MS
    metabonomics studies.</b> <i>Journal of proteome research</i> 2010, 9 (11), 5974-81
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    <strong>ADAP Aligner</strong> aligns features based on their mass spectra and retention time similarity.
    This approach is different from <strong>Join Aligner</strong> that aligns peaks
    across all samples, using their <em>m/z and retention time</em> similarity. Instead, <strong>ADAP Aligner</strong>
    uses <em>mass spectra and retention time</em> to detect similar compounds in each sample and align them together.
    Due to the usage of mass spectra, this algorithm's approach to the alignment is significantly different from the
    approach of <strong>Join Aligner</strong>. Therefore, <strong>ADAP Aligner</strong> requires mass spectra to
    be constructed prior to the alignment (e.g. using Spectral Deconvolution or CAMERA).
</p>

<p>
    In fact, this algorithm is similar to <strong>Hierarchical Aligner (GC)</strong>, but it uses a different
    clustering method.
</p>

<p>
    Similarity between two compounds is calculated by the following score:
</p>
<div align="center" style="margin: 10pt">
    S(C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>) = w S<sub>time</sub> + (1 - w) S<sub>spec</sub>
</div>
<p>
    where S<sub>time</sub> is the relative retention time difference between two compounds and S<sub>spec</sub> is the
    spectrum similarity between two compounds.
</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Min confidence</b> (number between 0 and 1) is a fraction of the total number of samples. An aligned compound
        must be detected at least in several samples. This parameter determines the minimum number of samples where a
        compound must be detected.
    </li>

    <li><b>Retention time range</b> (minutes) is the maximum allowed retention time difference between aligned compounds
        from different samples.</li>


    <li><b>M/z tolerance</b> is the maximum m/z difference, when two peaks from different mass spectra are considered
        equal.</li>

    <li><b>Score threshold</b> (number between 0 and 1) is the minimum value of the similarity function S(C<sub>1</sub>,
        C<sub>2</sub>) required for compounds to be aligned together.
    </li>

    <li><b>Score weight</b> (number between 0 and 1) is the weight w that is used in the similarity function
        S(C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>).
    </li>

    <li><b>Retention time similarity</b> chooses a method used for calculating the retention time similarity.
        The <b>retention time difference (fast)</b> is preferred method.
    </li>
</ul>
