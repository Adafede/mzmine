<h1>ADAP Aligner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This method aligns detected compounds in different samples through matching their mass fragmentation spectra and retention times.
</p>

<p>
    First, all compounds within a retention time range are collected from all samples. Then, pair-wise scores between those compounds are calculated as follows:
    <div align="center" style="margin: 10pt">
    S(C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>) = w S<sub>time</sub> + (1 - w) S<sub>spec</sub>
    </div>
    where S<sub>time</sub> is the relative retention time difference between two compounds and S<sub>spec</sub> is the
spectrum similarity between two compounds. Finally, a two-phase procedure is used to determine the best matching
compound in each sample. For more details, see the paper

</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Min confidence:</b> smallest fraction of samples where a compound should be detected. If the fraction of
        samples where a compound is detected is larger then <b>Min confidence</b>, then that compound is included in the
        list of aligned compounds. Otherwise, that compound is discarded. This parameter should be between 0 and 1.</li>

    <li><b>Retention time range:</b> maximum allowed retention time gap between aligned compounds</li>

    <li><b>Score tolerance:</b> the minimum matching score required for compounds to be included in the list of
    aligned compounds. This parameter should be between 0 and 1</li>

    <li><b> Score weight:</b> the weight w that is used in the scoring formula. If w = 0, then only the spectrum
    similarity is used for scoring. If w = 1, then only the retention time proximity is used for scoring.</li>

    <li><b>EIC score:</b> method used for calculating the retention time proximity. The <b>retention time difference (fast)</b> is preferred method.</li>
</ul>
