<h1>MS/MS visualizer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This tool displays a three-dimensional plot of the MSn data. The are 4 options for X and Y axes:
    Retention time, Precursor ion m/z, Product ion m/z, Neutral loss and 3 options for Z axis:
    Precursor ion intensity, Product ion intensity, Retention time. Also there is an option for
    diagnostic fragmentation filtering.
</p>

<h3>Diagnostic fragmentation filtering</h3>

<p>
    Due to common structural features, compounds within the same class undergo similar MS/MS fragmentation
    and as a result of many identical product ions and/or neutral losses.
    Diagnostic fragmentation filter (product ion filter) is a post-acquisition approach to screen
    LC-MS/MS datasets for entire classes of both known and unknown natural products. This tool searches
    all MS/MS spectra for product ions and/or neutral losses that has defined as being diagnostic for
    the entire class of compounds. In other words it screens LC-MS/MS datasets for MS/MS spectra
    containing production ions and/or neutral losses that are specific to that class of compounds.

    The user defines the diagnostic product ions and/or the diagnostic neutral loss values (Da) to
    use in the filtering. The user can also define the minimum diagnostic ion intensity (% base peak)
    to use in the filtering.If a recurrent neutral loss occurs, a line pattern in the plot can be observed.
    If compounds carrying those diagnostic product ions and/or the neutral loss values are detected
    the resulting plot will show their product ion m/z and precusor ion m/z. Additionally, an output
    file may be specified that will output the results of the filtering.

    This tool is very useful to get an overview of large amounts of MS/MS data.

    <dd>Selection of the Y axis of MS/MS plot. Options are the same as for X axis.</dd>

    <dt>Z axis</dt>
    <dd>Selection of the Z axis of MS/MS plot. There are 3 options:
    <ul>
        <li>Precursor ion intensity</li>

<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p>
    This plot is using the third part library JfreeChart for its basic functionality.
    To zoom in, drag the mouse from left to right, selecting the area to zoom. To zoom out drag the
    zoom from right to left. Axes types can be changed in the combo boxes below the plot.
    The user can also highlight spots in a range of precursor m/z with red color by clicking the button
    on the right side. Holding mouse on the data point will show a tooltip with detailed information.
    Double click will show spectrum plot of the spectrum of clicked data point.
