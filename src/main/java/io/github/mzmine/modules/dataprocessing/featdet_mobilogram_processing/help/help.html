  <title>Mobilogram Interpolation (experimental)</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Mobilogram interpolation</h1>

<p>
  This module can be used to interpolate between zero-values in mobilograms, if enough non-zero
  values are detected in the neighbourhood. This can be used to interpolate in for high resolution
  IMS data in the case that no ion package arrives at the detector due to low ion current. The use
  of this module is experimental, since it can also lead to a lot of noise being detected as a
  feature in later processing steps. (see <strong>figure 1</strong>, <strong>figure 2</strong>.)
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, this module should only be used for <strong>targeted</strong> approaches only when a
  specific compound
  has to be detected and instrumental optimisations cannot achieve the required result. For
  non-target approaches, the use of this module is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong>!
</p>

    Two features
    are now recognised in the mobilogram. Beware, the same processing parameters can lead to a lot
    of noise being recognised as a feature (see <strong>figure 2</strong>).

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<strong>Window width</strong> The number of consecutive mobility (and their corresponding intensity)
values to
be check by this algorithm.<br>
<strong>Number of non-zero intensities</strong> The number of non-zero intensities in the <strong>Window
  width</strong>
to be eligible for interpolation.<br>
<strong>Interpolation filter width</strong> The maximum number of values (=mobility scans) to be
checked for
neighbouring non-zero intensities during interpolation. If no value is found in that window, it will
be interpolated from 0.<br>
