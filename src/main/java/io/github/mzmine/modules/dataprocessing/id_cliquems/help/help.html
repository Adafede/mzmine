  <h1>CliqueMS</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p> This module uses the CliqueMS algorithm [<a href = "#ref1">1</a>] to group and annotate the features.</p>

  <h2>Parameters Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>PeakList</b> - Feature List on which cliqueMS algorithm is to be performed.</li>
    <li><b>Filter</b> - Filter out similar features if they pass all MZ, RT and intensity tolerances.
      Two features are considered similar if their relative change in m/z, rt and intensity are less than the respective tolerances. </li>
    <li><b>MZ tolerance</b> - If Filter option is set, this value determines the similarity of two
      features, if their relative difference of m/z values is less than this, they are considered similar. </li>
    <li><b>RT tolerance</b> - If Filter option is set, this value determines the similarity of two
      features, if their relative difference of retention times values is less than this, they are considered similar. </li>
    <li><b>Intensity tolerance</b> - If Filter option is set, this value determines the similarity of two
      features, if their relative difference of intensity is less than this, they are considered similar.</li>
    <li><b>Log - likelihood tolerance</b> -  The Log likelihood function is maximised for clique formation.
      The iterations are stopped when the relative change in current log likelihood with respect to the initial log likelihood is less than the log-likelihood tolerance value.</li>
