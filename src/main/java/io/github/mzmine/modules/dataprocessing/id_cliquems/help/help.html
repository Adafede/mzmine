  <h1>CliqueMS</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p> This module uses the CliqueMS algorithm [<a href = "#ref1">1</a>] to group and annotate the features.</p>

  <h2>Parameters Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>PeakList</b> - Feature List on which cliqueMS algorithm is to be performed.</li>
    <li><b>Filter</b> - Filter out similar features if they pass all MZ, RT and intensity tolerances.
      Two features are considered similar if their relative change in m/z, rt and intensity are less than the respective tolerances. </li>
    <li><b>MZ tolerance</b> - If Filter option is set, this value determines the similarity of two
      features, if their relative difference of m/z values is less than this, they are considered similar. </li>
    <li><b>RT tolerance</b> - If Filter option is set, this value determines the similarity of two
      features, if their relative difference of retention times values is less than this, they are considered similar. </li>
    <li><b>Intensity tolerance</b> - If Filter option is set, this value determines the similarity of two
      features, if their relative difference of intensity is less than this, they are considered similar.</li>
    <li><b>Log - likelihood tolerance</b> -  The Log likelihood function is maximised for clique formation.
      The iterations are stopped when the relative change in current log likelihood with respect to the initial log likelihood is less than the log-likelihood tolerance value.</li>
    <li><b>Filter similar features </b> - Marks all except one of the similar features. Two features are similar if their relative change in m/z, rt and intensity are less than the respective tolerances.  </li>
    <li><b>Isotopes max. charge</b> - The maximum charge considered when two features are tested to see they are isotope or not. No isotope will be annotated with a charge greater than this. </li>
    <li><b>Isotopes max. per cluster</b> - The maximum number of isotopes per cluster. Cluster will be resized if size found greater than this.  </li>
    <li><b>Isotopes mass tolerance </b> -  Mass tolerance used when identifying isotopes, relative error in ppm to consider that two features have the mass difference of an isotope,  Two features are considered isotopes if the difference of their absolute mass difference from the reference mass difference is within this tolerance limit</li>
    <li><b>Isotope reference mass difference </b> -  The reference mass difference between two features to be considered isotopes </li>
    <li><b>Annotation max annotation </b> -  All neutral masses in the group are ordered based on their adduct log-frequencies and their number of adducts. From that list, a number of these many masses are considered for the final annotation.</li>
    <li><b>Annotation feature max annotation </b> - In addition to 'topmasstotal', for each feature the list of ordered neutral masses is subsetted to the masses with an adduct in that particular feature. For each sublist, these number neutral masses are also selected for the final annotation. </li>
    <li><b>Annotation max features per clique </b> - After neutral mass selection, if a clique group has a number of monoisotopic features bigger than this parameter,  the annotation group is divided into non-overlapping annotation groups. Each subdivision is annotated independently.  </li>
    <li><b>Adduct polarity </b> - Adduct polarity  </li>
    <li><b>Annotation mass tolerance </b> -  Tolerance in mass according to which we consider two or more features compatible with a neutral mass and two or more adducts from Adduct List</li>
    <li><b>Annotation duplicate filter </b> - This parameter removes redundant annotations. If two neutral masses in the same annotation group have a relative mass difference smaller than this parameter and the same features and adducts, drop the neutral mass with less adducts  </li>
    <li><b>non-Annotation score </b> - Score given to non annotated features. The value should not be larger than any adduct log frequency (therefore given default value of -6.0, see log10freq of IonizationType)  </li>
    <li><b>Annotation Normalize score </b> - If 'TRUE', the reported score is normalized and scaled. Normalized score goes from 0, when it means that the raw score is close to the minimum score (all features with empty annotations), up to 100, which is the score value of the theoretical maximum annotation (all the adducts of the list with the minimum number of neutral masses). </li>
    </ul>
