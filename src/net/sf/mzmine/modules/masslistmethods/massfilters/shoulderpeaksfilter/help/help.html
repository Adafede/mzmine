<h1>FTMS shoulder peaks filter</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Raw data obtained from FTMS (Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer) instruments often contains false signals around high-intensity m/z peaks, called "shoulder peaks".
These signals are residues of the Fourier Transform function and their intensity is usually below 5% of the main (true) m/z peak.
The FTMS shoulder peaks filter attempts to remove these false signals. 
Detected m/z peaks are processed in the order of decreasing intensity.
A peak model (shape) is built around each m/z peak using given function and resolution, and those m/z peaks which fall below the model are considered to be shoulder peaks and are removed.
The method offers three peak models.

<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Mass resolution of the data</dt>
<dd>Defines the width of the model, which should be equal to the estimated resolution of the peaks in the raw data. Mass resolution is defined according to the following scheme:<br>

<dt>Peak model function</dt>
<dd>Defines the shape of the model function, as described below.</dd> 

</dl>

<h4>Gaussian peak model</h4>

<p>
The Gaussian peak model is a characteristic symmetric "bell shape curve" that quickly
 falls off towards plus/minus infinity, described by the following formula.

</p>

<p>
The parameter "a" is the height of the curve's peak, "b" is the position of the center of the peak,
 and "c" controls the width of the "bell".

<h4>Lorentzian peak model</h4>

<p>
The Lorentzian function (Cauchy-Lorentz distribution) is used for this model.<br>

</p>

<p>
The Lorentzian peak model is described by the following formula:<br>
<img src="LorentzianFormula.png"><br>
Where "x0" is the location parameter, specifying the location of the peak of the distribution,
 and "y" is the scale parameter which specifies the width of the peak.

<h4>Lorentzian extended peak model</h4>

<p>
This model uses the same mathematical formula as the Lorentzian peak model, but the lower part of the model (below 5% of the intensity)
is extended. The width of the peak below 5% intensity is calculated from another Lorentzian peak with 5% of the resolution of the main peak.
