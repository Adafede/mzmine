<h1>TIC plot</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This tool displays a plot of two dimensions, where X axis corresponds to retention time and Y axis is the intensity level of the signal. 
This visualization of the raw data corresponds to the chromatographic appearance of the data.
</p>
<p>
Generally this plot is well used in MZmine to display chromatographic peaks.
</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Raw data files</dt>
    	<dd>List of raw data files to display in TIC visualizer, with the possibility to chose one, many or all of them. 
    	The TIC will display all the chromatograms in the same plot.</dd>
	<dt>MS level</dt>
    	<dd>This refers to the scan level (MS<sup>1</sup>,MS<sup>2</sup>,... ,MS<sup>n</sup>) to be used to display the chromatogram.</dd>
	<dt>Plot type</dt>
    	<dd>Type of Y value calculation. TIC shows the sum of intensities, base peak shows the maximum intensity.</dd>
	<dt>Retention time</dt>
    	<dd>Retention time (X axis) range.</dd>
	<dt>m/z range</dt>
    	<dd>Range of m/z values. If this range does not include the whole scan m/z range, the resulting visualizer is XIC type.</dd>
	<dt>Selected peaks</dt>
    	<dd>List of chromatographic peaks to display in TIC visualizer. This is available only if a related peaklist to the selected 
    	raw data file exists in the current project.</dd>

</dl>
<p>
Additionally in the parameters window, the button "Set automatically" allows the user to set all the ranges automatically. 
MZmine will use the maximum ranges allowed by the raw data.
<p>

<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p>
This plot is using the third part library JfreeChart for its basic functionality. 
To zoom in, drag the mouse from left to right, selecting the area to zoom. To zoom out drag the zoom from right to left.

<p>
In the right part of the plot exist a group of icons which functionality is also included in a pop-up menu, 
which appears when you make right click on the plot area. 
</p>
<p>
When the mouse is passed over the plot a tool tip appears showing the information of that data point. 
If left click is done a crosshair lines will appear, indicating the selected position. Using the first button from the 
right panel is possible to visualize the spectrum.

<p>
To display the data points in the plot use the second icon on the right panel.

<p>
To display the label of the data points or modified the range of the axis use the third and fourth button from the right panel respectively.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to display the data from other raw data files in the same TIC plot window by using the options in the pop-up menu (left click on the plot area).

<p>
The submenu contents and option called "Set same range to all windows", which apply the same x and y ranges values to other TIC plot windows 
in the current project.
