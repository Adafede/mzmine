<h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">Spectrum analysis</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;" align="justify"; >
This chromatogram builder connects the received mass spectrum peak across the retention time
to one chromatogram based in a match score. This match score is set using as a criteria only
 the m/z value of the mass pectrum peaks passed by the mass detector. This builder determines
  which mass spectrum peaks are within the m/z range having as a central point the last mass 
  peak added to the current chromatogram.

<h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">Parameters</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;" align="justify"; >
This builder uses a two parameters:<br><br>
<i>"Min time span"</i><br><br>
This value sets the minimum length (time duration) for the chromatogram under construction. 
It exists the possibility that not all mass spectrum peaks collected on this chromatogram 
are continuous across the time domain. This builder remove those regions (group of mass spectrum
 peaks together) that not cover this value (small peak across the chromatogram considered as
 noise).<br><br> 
<i>"m/z tolerance"</i><br><br>
This value sets the range, in terms of m/z, to verify for possible mass spectrum peaks to be 
connected to chromatogram under construction.
