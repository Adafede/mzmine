        <h1>Adduct Search</h1>

        <h2>Method overview</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Adduct ion definition(in mass spectrometry)</b>
            <br>
            An ion formed by interaction of two species, usually an ion and a molecule,
and often within the ion source, to form an ion containing all the constituent
atoms of one species as well as an additional atom or atoms.

        </p>

        <p>
            This algorithm search for the adducts that are defined by the user in a single peak list.

        <h2>Adduct Search parameters</h2>

        <p>This aligner requires the next parameters:</p>

        <p><i>&quot;Time tolerance&quot;</i> <br>
            Maximum allowed difference of time to set a relationship between peaks.</p>

        <p><i>&quot;Adducts&quot;</i>
            <br>List of adducts, each one refers a specific distance in m/z axis between related peaks.</p>

        <p><i>&quot;Custom adduct value&quot;</i>
            <br>Specific distance in m/z axis between related peaks for custom adduct.</p>

        <p><i>&quot;M/Z tolerance&quot;</i>
            <br>Tolerance value of the m/z difference between peaks.</p>

        <p><i>&quot;Max adduct peak height&quot;</i>
            <br>Maximum height of the recognized adduct peak, relative to the main peak.</p>
