            <b>Adduct ion definition(in mass spectrometry)</b>
            <br>
            An ion formed by interaction of two species, usually an ion and a molecule,
and often within the ion source, to form an ion containing all the constituent
atoms of one species as well as an additional atom or atoms.

        <p>
            This algorithm search for the adducts that are defined by the user in a single peak list.
