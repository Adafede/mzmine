        <h1>Same m/z and RT Range filler</h1>

        <h2>Method overview</h2>
        <p>
            After the alignment, the resulting peak list could contain missing
            peaks as a product of a deficient peak detection or a mistake in the alignment of
            different peak lists.

            The fact that one peak is missing after the alignment doesn't implies that the
            peak doesn't exits. In most cases it is present but has remained undetected by the
            previous algorithms.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            The m/z and retention time ranges where the new peaks will be sought are obtained using the ranges of
            the rest of the peaks in the same row. The minimum value of these ranges is the minimum value in the range
            of all the peaks in the row and the same happens with the maximum value.
        </p>
