        <h1>Peak Finder</h1>

        <h2>Method overview</h2>
        <p>
            After the alignment, the resulting peak list could contain missing
            peaks as a product of a deficient peak detection or a mistake in the alignment of
            different peak lists.

            The fact that one peak is missing after the alignment doesn't implies that the
            peak doesn't exits. In most cases it is present but has remained undetected by the
            previous algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
            This algorithm fills the gaps in the peak list when it is possible according with the parameters
            defined by the user.
            The most crucial parameters are "m/z tolerance" and "RT tolerance" which define the window where
            the algorithm should find the new peak. It is centered in the m/z average and retention time average of
            the source peak list. Once the best candidate is found inside the window, its intensity and its shape in RT direction is also
            checked.

            It can also add a previous correction of the retention time in the case it is needed. It will
            change the position of the defined window depending on the prediction of a RT model created
            using all the already aligned peaks in each pair.

        </p>

        <h2>RT correction</h2>
        <p>
            When the RT correction is applied, the algorithm is divided in two main steps. In the first step,
            one random sample is taken from the multiple peak list and is used as a master list. All the gaps of this master list are filled using all the others samples.
            For each pair of samples the algorithm creates a model of the retention time.
            In the second step the master list is used to fill the gaps of the rest of the samples,
            creating also a retention time model for each pair (as is is showed in the figure below).
