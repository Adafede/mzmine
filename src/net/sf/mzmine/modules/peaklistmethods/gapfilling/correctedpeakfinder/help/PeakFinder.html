        <h1>Corrected Peak Finder</h1>

        <h2>Method overview</h2>
        <p>
            After the alignment, the resulting peak list could contain missing
            peaks as a product of a deficient peak detection or a mistake in the alignment of
            different peak lists.

            The fact that one peak is missing after the alignment doesn't implies that the
            peak doesn't exits. In most cases it is present but has remained undetected by the
            previous algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
            This algorithm is an extension of the "Peak Finder" algorithm which fills the gaps
            in the peak list if it is possible. It uses the
            same system to fill the gaps adding a previous correction of the retention time
            in the case it is needed.

        <h2>Corrected peak finder parameters</h2>

        <p>This aligner requires the next parameters:</p>

        <p><i>&quot;Name suffix&quot;</i> <br>
            This is the suffix to identify the new peak list in Peak list frame of
            desktop.</p>

        <p><i>&quot;Intensity tolerance&quot;</i>
            <br>This value sets the maximun allowed deviation from expected shape of a peak
            in chromatographic direction.</p>

        <p><i>&quot;M/Z tolerance&quot;</i>
            <br>This value sets the range, in terms of m/z, to search for possible peak in the raw
            data. Maximum allowed m/z difference.</p>

        <p><i>&quot;Absolute RT tolerance&quot;</i>
            <br>This value sets the range, in terms of retention time, to search for possible peak in the raw
            data. Maximum allowed m/z difference.</p>
