Peak Model function

To improve the spectrum evaluation procedure for this type of spectral data (FTMS),
a mathematical model of Gaussian / Lorentzian peak shape is used. Such a model 
describe a peak using the same attributes of spectral data ( m/z, resolution, intensity). 
All FTMS shoulder peaks under the curve of our modeled peak  are not considered as a 
possible MZPeak.
