Code


* Import & export for parameter values
Save/load values to/from config.xml at exit/startup already works, so this is quick to add.

* Statistical plots
Visualizers for ploting alignment results are missing. 

* Standard compound normalizer
Whole method is missing, but it is not top priority. Instead of the old simple standard compound normalizer, we should implement also the new NOMIS method.

* Many methods are really slow
- Join aligner is very slow although it is really simple. Speed it up if possible or change the whole method to a quicker one.
- Need to check what else is slow

* Finish raw data visualizers
- At least 2D visualizer is not yet finished. It should show detected peaks on top of the visualization.
- 3D-visualizer is not top priority.

* From peak list & alignment result table it should be possible to open raw data visualizers showing the detected or estimated peak:
- 2D visualizer with an overview of the region around the peak
- Spectrum showing scan at the highest position of the peak 
- XIC with area for the peak shaded (new feature)

* From raw data it should be possible to find nearest peak to cursor position and show it on a peak list and available alignment results.

* Update visualizers after data or peak list has been modified.
Currently it is necessary to open another visualizer to show updated data

* Design and implementation of isotope pattern information handling needs to be re-thinked
- Especially the IsotopePatternUtils class is quite confusing right now.

* Each module should provide a detailed description of all its parameters. 
- Parameter descriptions should be detailed enough to make software understandable.

* Writing the MZXML files is slow. Plan:
- Rewrite the IO
- Use the ProteomeCommons IO framework for reading all kinds of mass spec formats
- Keep scan headers in memory (scan number, retention time, mass range etc.)
- Write mz/intensity data to a very simple temporary binary data file, from which the data can be quickly loaded when needed


Other


* Write documentation for the new code

* Rewrite User's manual.
