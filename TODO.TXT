Code

* Data analysis
- CDA and Sammons plots are not implemented. 

* Standard compound normalizer
- Instead of the old simple standard compound normalizer, we should implement also the new NOMIS method.

* Gap filler
- Secondary peak picking is not implemented

* Finish raw data visualizers
- 2D visualizer is not yet finished. It should show detected peaks on top of the visualization.
- TIC, Spectra and 2D visualizer need a common dialog to set X/Y axis range
- "Set same axis range to other visualizers" menu item
- 3D-visualizer needs a setting for peak annotation threshold (annotate only peaks above given level), threshold in % or absolute
- TIC/2D/3D visualizer setup dialog should remember last range values and offer either default values (depending on file) or last values
- Datasets of JFreeChart library have to be updated in swing event-dispatching thread, otherwise exceptions can be thrown
- From raw data it should be possible to find nearest peak to cursor position and show it on a peak list and available alignment results
- Update visualizers after data or peak list has been modified.


* Alignment result table visualizer
- Display isotope pattern and charge of deisotoped peaks


* From peak list & alignment result table it should be possible to open raw data visualizers showing the detected or estimated peak:
- 2D visualizer with an overview of the region around the peak
- Spectrum showing scan at the highest position of the peak 
- XIC with area for the peak shaded (new feature)


* Each module should provide a detailed description of all its parameters. 
- Parameter descriptions should be detailed enough to make software understandable.


* IO
- User should be able to set mass precision per each file/MS level
- Use the ProteomeCommons IO framework for reading all kinds of mass spec formats


* Peak picking
- Peak picking method should limit detected peaks with minimum/maximum duration


* User interface
- Copy/paste
- Printing
- Undo


* Experimental parameters
- The IntensityPlot should be able to use parameter values for X axis (e.g. plot peak intensity dependance on sample amount)


* Compound identification
- Implement basic identification methods using KEGG/PubChem/custom database
- Implement in-source fragment identification
- Display identification results in alignment result visualizer


* Batch processing
- Sometimes batch processing hangs between two methods, like Centroid picker and Join aligner. A race condition bug?
- Batch module should save current batch in configuration
- Listing of batch steps should separate items by category (Peak detection, Deisotoping, Alignment, etc.)
- When running raw data filter in batch, next step has to use filtered raw data


* Dialogs
- Problems in entering acceptable values to formatted fields. For example retention times shown in AxesSetupDialog.



Other

* Write documentation for the new code

* Rewrite User's manual.
