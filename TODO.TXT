
TODO list for MZmine 2.0 release


***** Core modules *****

Project manager
* We need to reimplement project saving/loading using our own project file format. 
  Saving using serialization is too slow (2 hr saving a ~1 GB size project)
* Bug: projectParametersAndValues is indexed by String (filename), 
  but should be indexed by RawDataFile


Desktop
* ItemSelector should be replaced with a JTree which allows unfolding raw data 
  files into individual scans and peak lists into individual rows (Tomas)

Task controller
* Tasks with high priority (e.g. visualization) should never wait and always 
  allocate a thread
* Number of simultaneously running threads should be set in a configuration dialog,
  not by editing config file
* TaskListener and TaskGroup classes are obsolete and should be removed

***** Raw data import *****

Recognition of centroid/continuous scans is not perfect. 
Control1.CDF scan 1027 is recognized as centroid which is not true.
(Fixed 2009/2/2 Alex).


***** Raw data filtering *****

These algorithms are almost unchanged since original MZmine 1.
We should think how they can be applied to high-resolution data. 
Probably we need to improve the algorithms.


***** Peak detection *****

Shape modeler
* Under testing by users (2009/2/2 Alex)

Peak recognition
* Add checkbox "remove original chromatogram"


***** Visualizers *****

2D visualizer
* Need to set threshold for how many peaks will be annotated (Sandra)
* Color scale should be editable, similar as color scale of RT/MZ plots

3D visualizer
* Need to set threshold for how many peaks will be annotated

Peak list table
* Combined XIC component should have a nicer tooltip showing which color is 
  which data file
* PeakSummaryComponent may be integrated into the tooltip

Scatter plot
* Currently user can search only for compound name, but should also be able
  to search by mass/RT
* Bug: Typing invalid regular expression in the search box will cause an
  exception. (Fixed 2009/2/2 Alex)

Isotope pattern visualizer
* Bug: Show...isotope pattern invoked from peak list table doesn't highlight isotopes

TIC/XIC visualizer
* Visualizer should be able to show several peaks from one peaklist column
* When showing a particular peak, the dialog should offer "smarter" retention
  time range, same as 3D visualizer

Spectra visualizer
* Bug: sometimes fragment scans are shown twice in MS/MS combo

Peak list row summary visualizer (new)
* We should implement a new simple visualizer "Peak list row summary" with
  easy binding to all other visualizers and manual peak detection. This visualizer 
  can integrate the PeakSummaryComponent.


***** Identification *****

Related peaks search
* This module should perhaps be split into several modules for adduct search, 
  fragments search (using MS/MS), dimers etc. (Tomas)



***** Data analysis *****

RT/mz plots
* Color axis needs more informative title - instead of "Logratio" it should say 
  e.g. "log2(avg peak area(file1, file2) / avg peak area (file3, file4))"

PCA plot
* Bug: PCA plot may freeze if data contains Double.NaN




***** Documentation *****

Write documentation for the new code
* Comments in critical parts of the code (algorithms)
* Help files
* User's manual.
